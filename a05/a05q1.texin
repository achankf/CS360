Let's prove by 2-side inclusion.
\begin{claim}
2SPDA is not more powerful than Turing Machine
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
\input{a05q1_2spda_tm.texin}
\end{proof}
\begin{claim}
Turing Machine is not more powerful than 2SPDA
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
\input{a05q1_tm_2spda.texin}
\end{proof}
Therefore, 2SPDA has the same computing power as Turing Machine.
