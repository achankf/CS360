$q_0$ is the state of reading one $a$ and turing it into $A$.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Reading $a$, then change it it $A$, and goto $q_1$
\item
Reading $\Delta$, then reject because $\frac{n}{k}$ is undefined for $k = 0$.
\item
Reading $b$, then move to $q_1$.
\item
Reading $B$, then move to $q_{check}$.
\end{itemize}

$q_1$ is the state of reading $b$'s and turning them into $B$'s.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Reading $a$, then reject because $M$ has matched $a^*ba \not\in L_1$.
\end{itemize}
\done
