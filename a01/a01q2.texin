$\cap Y = \emptyset$.
Consider the following construction of a set of subsets of $N$ -- make subsets of $N$ with one of its element ``missing".
\begin{align*}
Y' &= \{ B = N \setminus \{x\} \subset N : x \in N \}
\end{align*}
Notice that $N \setminus B = \{x\}$, or the set that contains the ``missing" element, which is finite.
Then, $\cap Y' = \emptyset$ because of the missing element in each of the subsets.
Thus, $Y = Y' \cup (N \setminus Y')$ implies that $\cap Y = \emptyset$ as a consequence of $\cap Y' = \emptyset$.
